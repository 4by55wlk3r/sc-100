Antipatterns - A common mistake that lead to negative outcomes. Its the opposite of a best practice.

Examples of antipatterns:
    -We dont patch unless its critical.
    -Waiting for patch perfection instead of building resilience.
    -Focusing only on operating systems - This antipattern patches only servers and workstations without also addressing containers, applications, firmware, and IoT/OT devices.

Cybersecurity architects help integrate security best practices and make them actionable by doing the following:
-Integrating best practices into security architecture and policy.
-Advising security leaders on how to integrate best practices and which technology capabilities make best practices easier to implement/
-Advising other in the organization on how to integrate security best practices in their areas of ownership.

Zero Trust Architecture:
-Use least privilege access - Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just Enough Access (JIT/JEA), rick-based adaptive policies, and data protection.
-Assume breach - Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses.

The zero trust model assumes breach and verifies each request as though it originated from an uncontrolled network. 

With zero trust you want to make sure your networks are segmented correctly.
Use machine learning based threat protection and filtering with context based signals
All traffic is encrypted.
